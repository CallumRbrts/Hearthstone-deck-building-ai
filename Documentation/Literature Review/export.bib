   abstract = {In this paper we introduce a generative parametric model capable of producing high quality samples of natural images. Our approach uses a cascade of convo-lutional networks within a Laplacian pyramid framework to generate images in a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of the pyramid, a separate generative con-vnet model is trained using the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) approach [11]. Samples drawn from our model are of significantly higher quality than alternate approaches. In a quantitative assessment by human evaluators, our CIFAR10 samples were mistaken for real images around 40% of the time, compared to 10% for samples drawn from a GAN baseline model. We also show samples from models trained on the higher resolution images of the LSUN scene dataset.},

@inproceedings{MapElites,
   abstract = {Quality diversity (QD) algorithms such as MAP-Elites have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional single-objective optimization methods. They were initially applied to evolutionary robotics problems such as locomotion and maze navigation, but have yet to see widespread application. We argue that these algorithms are perfectly suited to the rich domain of video games, which contains many relevant problems with a multitude of successful strategies and often also multiple dimensions along which solutions can vary. This paper introduces a novel modification of the MAP-Elites algorithm called MAP-Elites with Sliding Boundaries (MESB) and applies it to the design and rebalancing of Hearthstone, a popular collectible card game chosen for its number of multidimensional behavior features relevant to particular styles of play. To avoid overpopulating cells with conflated behaviors, MESB slides the boundaries of cells based on the distribution of evolved individuals. Experiments in this paper demonstrate the performance of MESB in Hearthstone. Results suggest MESB finds diverse ways of playing the game well along the selected behavioral dimensions. Further analysis of the evolved strategies reveals common patterns that recur across behavioral dimensions and explores how MESB can help rebalance the game.},

   abstract = {Drafting in Magic: the Gathering is a sub-game of a larger trading card game, where several players progressively build decks by picking cards from a common pool. Drafting poses an interesting problem for game-playing and AI research due to its large search space, mechanical complexity, multiplayer nature, and hidden information. Despite this, drafting remains understudied in part due to a lack of high-quality, public datasets. To rectify this problem, we present a dataset of over 100,000 simulated, anonymized human drafts collected from Draftsim.com. Additionally, we propose four diverse strategies for drafting agents, including a primitive heuristic agent, an expert-tuned complex heuristic agent, a Naive Bayes agent, and a deep neural network agent. We benchmark their ability to emulate human drafting, and show that the deep neural network agent outperforms all other agents, while Naive Bayes and expert-tuned agents outperform simple heuristics. We analyze the accuracy of AI agents across the timeline of a draft, for different cards, and in terms of approximating subtle inconsistencies of human behavior, and describe unique strengths and weaknesses for each agent. This work helps to identify next steps in the creation of humanlike drafting agents, and can serve as a set of useful benchmarks for the next generation of drafting bots.},

   abstract = {Balancing an ever growing strategic game of high complexity, such as Hearthstone is a complex task. The target of making strategies diverse and customizable results in a delicate intricate system. Tuning over 2000 cards to generate the desired outcome without disrupting the existing environment becomes a laborious challenge. In this paper, we discuss the impacts that changes to existing cards can have on strategy in Hearthstone. By analyzing the win rate on match-ups across different decks, being played by different strategies, we propose to compare their performance before and after changes are made to improve or worsen different cards. Then, using an evolutionary algorithm, we search for a combination of changes to the card attributes that cause the decks to approach equal, 50% win rates. We then expand our evolutionary algorithm to a multi-objective solution to search for this result, while making the minimum amount of changes, and as a consequence disruption, to the existing cards. Lastly, we propose and evaluate metrics to serve as heuristics with which to decide which cards to target with balance changes.},

One way to address this issue is through the analysis of the cards resource costs. Powerful cards need more resource to be played while weaker ones need less resource. This work proposes a recommender system to a card's resource scale. In summary, we model the problem as a classification task and present and in-depth analysis of our results. We propose using LSTMs to learn a vector representation for text followed by XGBoost models to incorporate remaining features. Our approach is capable of reaching a Mean Reciprocal Rank of 0.8064 despite superficially identical cards having different mana costs. The analysis provided indicate that the model was able to learn useful rules for predicting a card's resource cost and highlight key insights for future research.},

While critics have discussed these terms with regards to game design and culture, âfree-to-playâ games like Blizzardâs Hearthstone add a monetary dimension to such considerations. Players can play such games for free, but success at them often entails purchasing in-game content. These games are sometimes instead derisively referred to as âpay-to-win:â players who spend money win more often. Free-to-play games suggest that casual and hardcore depend on how much money a player spends on the game, in addition to measures like time investment or play practices. I argue that free-to-play games encourage casual players to become more hardcore by spending more money on them in addition to improving their skills at the game, using Hearthstone as a case study to examine the implications of the free-to-play pricing structure on both game design and game players.},

With this shifted focus, the set of AI problems associated with video games has expanded from simply playing these games to win, to include playing games in particular styles, generating game content, modeling players, etc. Different games pose different challenges for AI systems, and several such AI challenges can typically be addressed in the same game. In this article we analyze the popular collectible card game Hearthstone published by Blizzard in 2014, and describe a varied set of interesting AI challenges it poses. Despite their popularity and associated interesting challenges, collectible card games are relatively understudied in the AI community. By analyzing a single game in-depth, we get a glimpse of the entire field of AI and games through the lens of a single game, discovering a few new variations on existing research topics.},

An interesting aspect of this game domain is the strong influence of their metagame: in this particular case deck-construction. Before a game starts, players select which cards from a vast card pool they want to take into the current game session, defining their available options and a great deal of their strategy. We introduce an approach to do automatic deck construction for the digital Trading Card Game Hearthstone, based on a utility system utilizing several metrics to cover gameplay concepts such as cost effectiveness, the mana curve, synergies towards other cards, strategic parameters about a deck as well as data on how popular a card is within the community. The presented approach aims to provide useful information about a deck for a player-level AI playing the actual game session at runtime. Herein, the key use case is to store information on why cards were included and how they should be used in the context of the respective deck. Besides creating new decks from scratch, the algorithm is also capable of filling holes in existing deck skeletons, fitting an interesting use case for Human Hearthstone players: adapting a deck to their specific pool of available cards. After introducing the algorithms and describing the different utility sources used, we evaluate how the algorithm performs in a series of experiments filling holes in existing decks of the Hearthstone eSports scene.},

This kind of games offers several challenges for researchers in artificial intelligence since they involve hidden information, unpredictable behaviour, and a large and rugged search space. Besides, an important part of player engagement in such games is a periodical input of new cards in the system, which mainly opens the door to new strategies for the players. Playtesting is the method used to check the new card sets for possible design flaws, and it is usually performed manually or via exhaustive search; in the case of Hearthstone, such test plays must take into account the chosen hero, with its specific kind of cards. In this paper, we present a novel idea to improve and accelerate the playtesting process, systematically exploring the space of possible decks using an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). This EA creates HearthStone decks which are then played by an AI versus established human-designed decks. Since the space of possible combinations that are play-tested is huge, search through the space of possible decks has been shortened via a new heuristic mutation operator, which is based on the behaviour of human players modifying their decks. Results show the viability of our method for exploring the space of possible decks and automating the play-testing phase of game design. The resulting decks, that have been examined for balancedness by an expert player, outperform human-made ones when played by the AI; the introduction of the new heuristic operator helps to improve the obtained solutions, and basing the study on the whole set of heroes shows its validity through the whole range of decks.}

   abstract = {One of the most notable features of collectible card games is deckbuilding, that is, defining a personalized deck before the real game. Deckbuilding is a challenge that involves a big and rugged search space, with different and unpredictable behaviour after simple card changes and even hidden information. In this paper, we explore the possibility of automated deckbuilding: a genetic algorithm is applied to the task, with the evaluation delegated to a game simulator that tests every potential deck against a varied and representative range of human-made decks. In these preliminary experiments, the approach has proven able to create quite effective decks, a promising result that proves that, even in this challenging environment, evolutionary algorithms can find good solutions.},

@article{Such2017,
   abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of neuroevolution techniques that improve performance. We demonstrate the latter by showing that combining DNNs with novelty search, which encourages exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g.\ DQN, A3C, ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA is faster than ES, A3C, and DQN (it can train Atari in $\{\raise.17ex\hbox\{$\scriptstyle\sim$\}\}$4 hours on one desktop or $\{\raise.17ex\hbox\{$\scriptstyle\sim$\}\}$1 hour distributed on 720 cores), and enables a state-of-the-art, up to 10,000-fold compact encoding technique.},

One example in chemistry is the design of tailor-made organic materials and molecules, which requires efficient methods to explore the chemical space. We present a genetic algorithm (GA) that is enhanced with a neural network (DNN) based discriminator model to improve the diversity of generated molecules and at the same time steer the GA. We show that our algorithm outperforms other generative models in optimization tasks. We furthermore present a way to increase interpretability of genetic algorithms, which helped us to derive design principles.},
