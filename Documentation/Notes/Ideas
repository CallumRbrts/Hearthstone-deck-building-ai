    Fitness: 
        ~ Simulator?
        ~ Correctness? Victories? Standard deviation?
        ~ Strategic Deck Parameters? Crowd-Sourced Knowledge? Mana Curve? Cost effectivemess? Synergies?
    
    Neural Network
        ~ Initialize model with human-played games -> ask how to do this
        ~ Ai agents -> in a tournament
        ~ NN is updated based on performance
        ~ New agents by dropping bad ones and mutating successful ones
        
    Try testing 10, 15, 100 times etc...
    
    Particle Swarm
    Ant Hill
    Bee Colony 
    
    NN as a Surrogate model instead of simulator -> Use the GA to create the deck and use the Surrogate model to predict the wr
    NN as a Simulator instead of a Surrogate model -> Use the GA to create the deck then use the simulator to determine the wr
    Compare the two.

            - State that a review of the literature is valuable in understanding important aspects of your research area (reference the lecture)
            - Clarify the scope that overall organisation of the idea ~ Structure
        ~ Body - by theme
            - Genetic Algorithm (do not separate these into subthemes, need to synthesise)

        ~ Conclusion
            - Compare NN and GA, why they are different and why we need to test both methods
            - My approach
                > Create a NN with a GA surrogate model to negate the execution time
        
        Sets the credibility, why people should believe you?
        Why is no one using a NN algorithm? What make doesn't it already exist? How well has similar stuff worked? Where is that being used?

        Word count on lit review?
        Structure?
        Abstract?
        How to make dataset for NN? What kind of dataset? What kind of data would I need for my NN in terms of human-based games?
        
    - Use GA algorithm to create the deck ~ Can I use DEAP? MicroGP?
    - Simulator: ~ MetaStone
    
    - Use a Neural Network Deep Learning to create the deck ~ Can I use PyTorch?
    - Is it possible to combine the two? Use the NN as the fitness function for the GA?
    - Can I base my Honours Project on both aspects separatly?
    - Attempt to inplement a NN using gradient decent (such as mean squared error) and with a GA instead to calculate the weight
    - Surrogate Model? ~ Guesses if it wins, do more research, less accurate but faster
    
    - How to launch an AI on a simulator?
    
    - Critical engagement ~ Lit review, crititise the simulator, the reason why they chose different simulators, time consuming, faster, less accurate etc... Why I may choose not to opt for a simulator and go for something else for the fitness function. To get an A in lit review. 
    
    
    - Ask how to make a dataset to train my NN 
    - Probably will need to make my own dataset by coding a card collection generator (whilst guaranteeing that at least the classic set will be a part if it), add a potential value to it (rarity or how good the card is ~ check mtg draftsim19 dataset for reference)
    - Web scrape decks by highest winrate to use as training
    
    - For the fitness function get a wide variety of decks from HSReplay or from an expert and use a simulator to play games using our decks vs the top "meta" decks ~ calculates fitness through winrate (Deap selTournament() function) ~ Potentially good but time consuming toooooooo time consuming. 
    Maybe calculate a score based of the mana curve, synergy, class cards etc.. instead to save time but lose accuracy
    Maybe use a conbination of both - Supervised Learning ~ research this
    
    - Stop GA when wr exceeds 60%, after n generations, algo plateau's
    
    - test the idea with a random pool of cards and with all the cards. test against opponents with the same pool and all the cards
    
    - assume that the player has completed the tutorial on every character
    
    - Have a whole comparison thing going on. So I generate a random deck. Then a GA. Then a NN. Compare them all.
