    Neural Network
        ~ Initialize model with human-played games -> ask how to do this
        ~ Ai agents -> in a tournament
        ~ NN is updated based on performance
        ~ New agents by dropping bad ones and mutating successful ones
        
    Try testing 10, 15, 100 times etc...
    
    Particle Swarm

    NN as a Surrogate model instead of simulator -> Use the GA to create the deck and use the Surrogate model to predict the wr
    NN as a Simulator instead of a Surrogate model -> Use the GA to create the deck then use the simulator to determine the wr
    Compare the two.

        ~ Conclusion
            - Compare NN and GA, why they are different and why we need to test both methods

        Sets the credibility, why people should believe you?
        Why is no one using a NN algorithm? What make doesn't it already exist? How well has similar stuff worked? Where is that being used? 
       
    
       
        ~ Generative Adversarial Networks:
            - Convert HS cards into an image and then use that to train the model
            - Is it possible to covert the cards into a value for the GAN?
            - Everyone uses GAN's for images, why is that?
            - How do they convert the images into numbers?
            - When trying to implement it, start by doing a classic one for numbers or faces then try to convert that into a deckbuilding one

        Word count on lit review?
        Structure?
        Abstract?
        How to make dataset for NN? What kind of dataset? What kind of data would I need for my NN in terms of human-based games?
        
    - Use GA algorithm to create the deck ~ Can I use DEAP? MicroGP?
    - Simulator: ~ MetaStone
    
    - Use a Neural Network Deep Learning to create the deck ~ Can I use PyTorch?
    - Is it possible to combine the two? Use the NN as the fitness function for the GA?
    - Can I base my Honours Project on both aspects separatly?
    - Attempt to inplement a NN using gradient decent (such as mean squared error) and with a GA instead to calculate the weight
    - Surrogate Model? ~ Guesses if it wins, do more research, less accurate but faster
    
    - How to launch an AI on a simulator?
    
    - Critical engagement ~ Lit review, crititise the simulator, the reason why they chose different simulators, time consuming, faster, less accurate etc... Why I may choose not to opt for a simulator and go for something else for the fitness function. To get an A in lit review. 
    
    
    - Ask how to make a dataset to train my NN 
    - Probably will need to make my own dataset by coding a card collection generator (whilst guaranteeing that at least the classic set will be a part if it), add a potential value to it (rarity or how good the card is ~ check mtg draftsim19 dataset for reference)
    - Web scrape decks by highest winrate to use as training
    
    - For the fitness function get a wide variety of decks from HSReplay or from an expert and use a simulator to play games using our decks vs the top "meta" decks ~ calculates fitness through winrate (Deap selTournament() function) ~ Potentially good but time consuming toooooooo time consuming. 
    Maybe calculate a score based of the mana curve, synergy, class cards etc.. instead to save time but lose accuracy
    Maybe use a conbination of both - Supervised Learning ~ research this
    
    - Stop GA when wr exceeds 60%, after n generations, algo plateau's
    
    - test the idea with a random pool of cards and with all the cards. test against opponents with the same pool and all the cards
    
    - assume that the player has completed the tutorial on every character
    
    - Have a whole comparison thing going on. So I generate a random deck. Then a GA. Then a NN. Compare them all.

    
    
    
#Equivalent generate latent points function for decks?
#how would I generate "fake" decks from the generator? 
# - The generator usually takes a noise vector from the latent dimension. How would I do that in my problem? Do I need to create a sort of histogram function that "encapsulates" a deck and all the cards from every data row are added to it, then the chosen deck highlights the points on the chart? Then the latent dimension will take points from that histogram, but I don't know if that's too random or not.
#how would I convert the decks into vectors to feed into the Network? 
# - Maybe by creating a collection of cards and associate a key to their name and use those keys to create a vector of shape[30]
#Feeding vectors of decks should work right? 
#which of the examples should I base myself off? Are they both correct?
