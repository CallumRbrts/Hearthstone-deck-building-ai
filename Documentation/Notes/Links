Euclidean distance to calculate mana curve (comparing it to a / multiple "ideal" curves)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41492731/how-to-use-euclidean-distance-to-calculate-similarity-values-for-the-three-pairs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance


In a genetic algorithm, the more rules that determine what a good deck is the better. So we could make an AI that bases the best deck from the cards you own, or of all the cards.
Rules: 
    - Mana Curve
    - Types of cards (Spells, Hero Cards, Minions etc...) -> how many of each we should have
    - Archtypes -> we could use quests / lendaries as "win conditions" and attempt to prioritise cards that synergizes with those lengendaries
    - Card power
    - Eliminate redundancy -> if we have divine shield deck we don't want cards that give divine shield
    - Tribes
    - Card limit (1 or 2)
    
We should use a point system that is applied to either the deck as a whole or an individual card -> more points better the deck
